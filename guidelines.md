# Guidelines (Updated 2026-01-22)

## 1. Project Goal & Scope
*   **The Goal:** Create a robust R&D pipeline to eliminate "Internal Swelling" in the **Morgan MG1157 Phase Brush**, ensuring consistent contact in wind turbine generators.
*   **The Artifact:** The output is the **pipeline strategy itself**, structured specifically as a **technical presentation** (Problem -> Theory -> Experiment -> Analysis).
*   **Target Product:** Phase brush MG1157 (Morgan Advanced Materials).

## 2. Operational Context
*   **Identity:** We act as **Morgan Advanced Materials (Corporate R&D)**.
*   **Constraint 1:** The pipeline focuses **exclusively on R&D (I+D)** activities.
*   **Constraint 2:** The pipeline operates under the assumption of **unlimited funds**.
*   **Constraint 3 (Differentiation):** We must distinguish our corporate approach from academic/university methods by emphasizing scalability, proprietary process control, and data-driven decision-making.

## 3. Mandatory Methodology (Alignment with Team Strategy)
Based on `colegas_3.md` and `pptx_structure.md`, the pipeline MUST adhere to the following execution framework:

*   **Variables:** The investigation is strictly limited to the 4 "Process Levers":
    1.  **Binder Type** (Chemistry).
    2.  **Pressing Pressure** (Mechanical).
    3.  **Carbonization Temperature** (Thermal).
    4.  **Impregnation/Coating** (Post-Process).

*   **Data Analysis Workflow:**
    *   **Tooling:** All statistical analysis must be performed using **Python / Jupyter Notebooks**.
    *   **Phase 1:** Sensitivity Analysis via **ANOVA** to identify density drivers.
    *   **Phase 2:** Factorial Design to map variable interactions.
    *   **Phase 3:** Decision making via **Pareto Charts** to select the optimal formulation.

## 4. Presentation Structure (Final Output)
The project documentation must mirror the final presentation flow:
1.  **Problem Definition:** Internal Swelling & Tolerance.
2.  **Theoretical Framework:** Manufacturing Stages (Raw Materials, Shaping, Carbonization, Treatments).
3.  **Experimental Proposal:** DOE of the 4 variables + Jupyter Analysis.
