# CEO Directive: Strategic Simplification of Parameters

**To:** Chief Technology Officer (CTO)
**From:** CEO, Morgan Advanced Materials
**Date:** 2026-01-22
**Subject:** REVIEW REQUEST - Are we overcomplicating the inputs?

I have reviewed Pipeline 7.0. While I appreciate the rigorous testing protocols (Anisotropy, Accelerated Aging) you enforced, I am concerned that the **Input Space (Phase 1)** has become too broad and chaotic. We are changing everything at once: Chemistry, Structure, Metal Content, Porosity Additives, and Lubricants.

## My Proposal: Focus on the "Process Levers"
From a manufacturing and cost-control perspective, I believe we can solve this problem by tuning our existing process rather than reinventing the entire material science of the brush.

I want to restrain the evaluation to these **4 Core Manufacturing Parameters**:

1.  **Binder Type:** (The chemistry root cause).
2.  **Pressing Pressure:** (Directly controls density and open porosity without messy additives like PEG).
3.  **Carbonization Temperature:** (Controls the final structure, pore closure, and binder graphitization).
4.  **Coating/Impregnation:** (Post-process treatment with Silanes or Oils to seal the surface).

## The Question to You
**Am I correct in selecting these 4 as the most relevant levers?**

*   *Hypothesis:* By optimizing Pressure and Temperature, we can mechanically close the pores that cause swelling, and by optimizing Binder and Coating, we chemically reject the water.
*   *Exclusion:* Do we really need to mess with the **Metal Content** (Ag%) and **Solid Lubricants** (MoS2) right now? Changing silver content disrupts our conductivity ratings and requires massive re-qualification. Adding MoS2 changes our mixing lines.

I want a sanity check. If I strip the pipeline down to these 4 variables, do we still have a high probability of solving the swelling issue?
