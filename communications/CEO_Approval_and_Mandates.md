# CEO Approval: Greenlight for "Full Matrix" Protocol

**To:** Head of Pipeline Design
**From:** CEO, Morgan Advanced Materials (Electrical Carbon Division)
**Date:** 2026-01-22
**Subject:** APPROVAL GRANTED - Proceed with Option 3 & Carbon Investigation

I have reviewed your strategic response. Your logic holds up, and I am approving the **"Full Matrix" (Option 3)** approach.

## 1. On the "Carbon Phase" Proposal
Your proposal to investigate **Synthetic vs. Natural Graphite** is approved and technically sound.
*   **Internal Verification:** Our internal data (and general industry physics) confirms that Synthetic Electro-Graphite typically exhibits lower open porosity and higher density than Natural Flake equivalents due to the high-temperature graphitization process ordering the lattice.
*   **The Morgan Advantage:** Remember, we are not limited to off-the-shelf powders. Use our supply chain to source **high-purity synthetic grades** with controlled Particle Size Distribution (PSD). We need to see if a tighter PSD packing factor can mechanically reduce the void space available for water uptake.

## 2. A Critical Warning: The "Dry Brush" Risk
While you are chasing "Hydrophobicity," do not forget **Tribology 101**.
*   **The Science:** A carbon brush *requires* a microscopic layer of water vapor to lubricate the sliding contact. If you succeed in creating a perfectly hydrophobic material (e.g., heavily fluorinated binder + synthetic carbon), you risk creating a "dry running" condition.
*   **The Risk:** Without moisture, the friction coefficient ($\mu$) will skyrocket, leading to rapid brush wear (dusting) or ring damage.
*   **Mandate:** In your 3D Visualizations, I want you to overlay a **"Tribological Safe Zone"**. Any formulation that minimizes swelling but spikes Friction ($\mu > 0.25$) is a failure.

## 3. Directives for Execution
1.  **Budget:** Unlocked. Procurement is authorized to acquire the necessary Silanes and Synthetic Graphite variants immediately.
2.  **Timeline:** I expect the Phase 2 Screening results on my desk in **3 weeks**.
3.  **Safety:** Ensure the Health & Safety team signs off on the new Silane protocols before a single bottle is opened.

You have the resources. You have the mandate. Now deliver the solution.

**Signed,**
CEO
