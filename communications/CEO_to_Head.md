# CEO Directive: Strategic Clarification on Pipeline 5.0

**To:** Head of Pipeline Design
**From:** CEO
**Date:** 2026-01-22
**Subject:** CLARIFICATION REQUIRED - Material Scope & Visual Deliverables

I have reviewed your "High-Precision" Pipeline 5.0. While the technical rigor is improved, I need to understand the strategic boundaries of this R&D effort before approving the budget.

## 1. The Core Strategic Question
Your document mentions testing "Binder Chemistry" (Pitch, Modified Phenolic, Furan) and "Metal/Graphite Ratio" (30-70%). I need you to be explicit about the scope of our exploration:

**Are we testing:**
1.  **New Ratios Only?** (Using the *existing* components of MG1157 but just changing the % mix?)
2.  **New Materials Only?** (Replacing Phenolic with Pitch, but keeping the 50/50 ratio?)
3.  **Both?** (Are we exploring a matrix where we introduce *new* Carbon/Binder types AND simultaneously sweep through *new* Metal ratios?)

*Note:* If the answer is #3, the complexity explodes. I need to know if you are prepared for that. I will be verifying the logic of your parameter selection with the CTO, so ensure your reasoning is bulletproof.

## 2. Mandatory Output: The "Boardroom Visuals"
I do not want spreadsheets. I want clear, actionable visualizations to present to the Board.

As the output of this project, I expect **3D Surface Plots**:
*   **X-Axis:** Parameter 1 (e.g., Metal Content %)
*   **Y-Axis:** Parameter 2 (e.g., Binder Type or Porosity %)
*   **Z-Axis:** **Swelling (% Dimensional Change)**

**Crucially:**
*   If we are testing multiple material classes (e.g., Phenolic vs. Pitch), I expect **separate 3D plots for each material class** if they cannot be combined into a single continuous axis.
*   Do not give me one messy graph. If the answer to my question above is "Both," I want to see a Comparative Series (e.g., Graph A: Phenolic System, Graph B: Pitch System) to clearly visualize the "Swelling Landscape."

Clarify these points immediately.

**Signed,**
The CEO
