# Pipeline Version 6.0 (The Morgan "Full Matrix" Protocol)

**Company:** Morgan Advanced Materials (Electrical Carbon Division)
**Project:** MG1157-NextGen (Wind Turbine Generator Brush)
**Objective:** Solve Swelling via Material Science Innovation while maintaining Tribological Safety.
**Status:** **APPROVED FOR EXECUTION**

## Phase 1: The "Full Matrix" Input Space
**Goal:** Define the comprehensive variable set for the high-throughput screening.

### Variable A: Binder Chemistry (The Hydrophobic Engine)
1.  **Baseline:** Phenolic Resin (Novolac hexamine-cured).
2.  **Challenger 1:** **Coal Tar Pitch** (High Softening Point).
3.  **Challenger 2:** **Furan Resin** (High Char Yield).

### Variable B: Carbon Source (The Structural Matrix)
1.  **Baseline:** Natural Flake Graphite.
2.  **Challenger:** **Synthetic Electro-Graphite** (High Purity, Ordered Lattice).
    *   *Sourcing:* Internal Morgan Supply Chain (Grade E-Graphite High Density).

### Variable C: Metal Content (The Thermal/Mechanical Balancer)
*   **Range:** **30% to 70% Silver (Ag)**.
*   *Step:* 10% increments for screening.

### Variable D: Porosity Control (The Expansion Buffer)
*   **Range:** 5% to 20% Open Porosity.
*   *Control:* Isostatic Pressure + PEG Pore Formers.

## Phase 2: High-Throughput Screening (OFAT + Mini-Matrix)
**Timeline:** Weeks 1-3
**Goal:** Identify the primary drivers of swelling and friction.

*   **Experimental Design:**
    *   Run parallel tracks for **Natural vs. Synthetic** graphite.
    *   For each track, screen the 3 Binders.
    *   Hold Metal at 50% (Center Point) for initial screening.
*   **Measurements:**
    *   $\Delta V$ (Dimensional Swelling) after 168h @ 95% RH / 60°C.
    *   $\mu$ (Friction Coefficient) via Pin-on-Disc tribometer (Dry & Humid).

## Phase 3: Critical Optimization (CCD Response Surface)
**Goal:** Map the "Safe Zone."

*   **Design:** Central Composite Design (CCD).
*   **Axes:**
    *   $X$: Metal Content (30-70%)
    *   $Y$: Porosity (5-20%)
*   **Categorical Factors:** The "Winning" Binder + "Winning" Carbon from Phase 2.
*   **Outputs:**
    *   Surface $Z_1$: Swelling %.
    *   Surface $Z_2$: Friction Coefficient ($\mu$).

## Phase 4: The CEO's Deliverable (The "Boardroom Visuals")
**Goal:** Clear decision support.

We will generate **Comparative 3D Surface Plots**:
1.  **Graph A: The "Danger Zone" (Swelling)**
    *   Shows regions where Swelling > Tolerance.
2.  **Graph B: The "Tribological Safe Zone" (Friction)**
    *   **Overlay Layer:** A translucent red plane at $\mu = 0.25$.
    *   Any point *above* this plane is rejected (Dry Running Risk).
3.  **Graph C: The "Sweet Spot"**
    *   The intersection volume where **Swelling $\approx$ 0** AND **$\mu < 0.25$**.

---

## Phase 5: Production Validation (Morgan Standard)
**Goal:** Scale-up.

*   **Batch Size:** 500 Units (Pilot Line).
*   **Rig Test:** 20 A/cm² Overload Test (500 hours).
*   **Safety:** Full HAZMAT protocols for Silane/Pitch handling in effect.
