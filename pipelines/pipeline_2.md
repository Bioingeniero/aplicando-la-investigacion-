# Pipeline Version 2.0 (Product Innovation & Commercialization)

**Objective:** Engineer, patent, and commercialize a proprietary material enhancement for generator phase brushes (Base: MG1157) to eliminate swelling and establish market dominance.

**Response to CEO Directive:** This pipeline completely abandons the defensive "maintenance" approach. We are shifting 100% of resources to R&D to develop "The [Company Name] Stabilized Phase Brush." We treat the existing MG1157 not as a final product, but as a substrate for our high-value value-add.

## Phase 1: Deep Material Forensics & Characterization
*   **Goal:** Reverse-engineer the swelling mechanism at the molecular level to identify the specific modification target.
*   **Actions:**
    *   **Porosity & Absorption Analysis:** Quantify the hygroscopic properties of the base MG1157 graphite/binder matrix using mercury intrusion porosimetry.
    *   **Chemical Profiling:** Identify reactive sites within the binder that bond with water vapor.
    *   **Thermal Expansion Baseline:** Establish precise Coefficient of Thermal Expansion (CTE) curves under varying humidity levels to serve as the "Competitor Baseline" for our datasheets.
*   **Lead:** R&D (Materials Science Division)

## Phase 2: Proprietary Enhancement Development (The "Secret Sauce")
*   **Goal:** Develop and prototype three distinct stabilization treatments.
*   **Actions:**
    *   **Track A (Hydrophobic Impregnation):** Vacuum-pressure impregnation of the brush with high-temperature hydrophobic resins to block moisture uptake.
    *   **Track B (Surface Sealing):** Development of a conductive, semi-permeable nano-coating that prevents water ingress but allows outgassing.
    *   **Track C (Thermal Conditioning):** An proprietary annealing process to relax internal stresses and close open porosity.
    *   **Outcome:** Produce 10 prototypes of each track for immediate testing.
*   **Lead:** R&D / Chemical Engineering

## Phase 3: Comparative Performance Validation (Head-to-Head)
*   **Goal:** Generate irrefutable data proving our product's superiority over the stock MG1157.
*   **Actions:**
    *   **Aggressive Environmental Chamber Testing:** Run "Our Brush" vs. "Stock Brush" in 95% relative humidity and thermal cycling.
    *   **Data Generation for Marketing:** Record side-by-side swelling metrics. We need a chart that shows the Stock Brush failing while ours remains stable.
    *   **Electrical Conductivity Verification:** Ensure our treatments do not degrade the electrical performance (voltage drop/current density).
*   **Lead:** R&D / QA (Testing Lab)

## Phase 4: Intellectual Property & Commercialization
*   **Goal:** Protect the asset and prepare for market launch.
*   **Actions:**
    *   **Patent Filing:** File provisional patents for the successful treatment formula and application process.
    *   **Datasheet Creation:** Publish technical specs highlighting "Zero-Swell Technology."
    *   **Business Case:** Define pricing strategy (Premium over stock MG1157) and identify initial customers (other operators using MG1157).
*   **Lead:** Product Management / Legal
