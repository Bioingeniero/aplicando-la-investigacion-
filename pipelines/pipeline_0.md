# Pipeline Version 0 (Provisional)

**Objective:** Develop a systematic corporate pipeline to address the loss of contact in generator phase brushes (Model: MG1157, Morgan Advanced Materials) caused by swelling.

**Context:** This pipeline represents a preliminary corporate workflow, prioritizing efficiency, scalability, and operational continuity over pure academic exploration.

---

## Phase 1: Problem Definition & Data Acquisition
*   **Goal:** Quantify the extent of the swelling issue and its operational impact.
*   **Actions:**
    *   Collect field data on MG1157 performance failure rates.
    *   Define specific operational conditions (temperature, humidity, load) leading to swelling.
    *   Acquire technical specifications and material safety data sheets (MSDS) for the MG1157 brush.
*   **Lead:** Maintenance & Services / Operations

## Phase 2: Root Cause Analysis (RCA)
*   **Goal:** Determine the precise mechanism causing the swelling.
*   **Actions:**
    *   Conduct material analysis on failed samples (chemical/physical).
    *   Simulate operational environments to reproduce the swelling.
    *   Investigate potential manufacturing inconsistencies or storage issues.
*   **Lead:** R&D / Engineering (supported by QA)

## Phase 3: Solution Strategy & Feasibility
*   **Goal:** Identify and select the most viable remediation strategy.
*   **Actions:**
    *   Evaluate potential solutions:
        *   *Material substitution:* Partner with supplier for resistant grades.
        *   *Design modification:* Alter brush geometry or holder tolerances.
        *   *Environmental control:* Modify generator cooling/humidity control.
    *   Perform Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) for each option.
*   **Lead:** Product Management (with R&D and Supply Chain inputs)

## Phase 4: Validation & Testing
*   **Goal:** Verify the chosen solution effectiveness without disrupting operations.
*   **Actions:**
    *   **Lab Testing:** Accelerated aging tests on the proposed solution.
    *   **Pilot Test:** Implement solution on a non-critical generator unit.
    *   Measure swelling metrics against the baseline (MG1157 original).
*   **Lead:** R&D / QA

## Phase 5: Implementation & Deployment
*   **Goal:** Roll out the solution across the fleet.
*   **Actions:**
    *   Develop Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for the new brush/modification.
    *   Coordinate supply chain for new parts.
    *   Schedule maintenance windows for replacement.
*   **Lead:** Operations / Maintenance

## Phase 6: Monitoring & Continuous Improvement
*   **Goal:** Ensure long-term stability.
*   **Actions:**
    *   Establish specific KPIs for contact stability.
    *   Quarterly review of brush wear and dimension logs.
*   **Lead:** QA / Maintenance
