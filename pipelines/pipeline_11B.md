# Appendix 11B: The Chemical Track (Binder Protocol)
**Presentation Section:** 2. Theoretical Framework & 3. Experimental Proposal
**Slide Mapping:** Slide 6 (Raw Materials) & Slide 11 (Variables)

## 1. Variable A: Binder Candidates (The "Ingredient Change")
*   **Baseline:** **Phenolic Resin** (Novolac).
    *   *Characteristics:* Easy processing, but high hygroscopicity.
*   **Challenger 1:** **Coal Tar Pitch**.
    *   *Characteristics:* High aromaticity, naturally hydrophobic. Requires hot mixing (150°C).
*   **Challenger 2:** **Furan Resin**.
    *   *Characteristics:* High char yield, rigid structure. Acid-catalyzed room temp mixing.

## 2. Standardization Protocol (Rheology)
To ensure valid comparison across different chemistries:
*   **Target Viscosity:** 1000 cPs ($\pm$ 200).
*   **Normalization:** Temperature or solvent adjustment to match flow characteristics during mixing.
