# Pipeline Version 2.1 (Technical Safety & High-Performance Validation)

**Objective:** Engineer, validate, and commercialize a proprietary generator phase brush (Base: MG1157) that eliminates swelling *without* compromising electrical commutation or mechanical integrity.

**Response to CTO Critique:** This version integrates the "Safety-Critical" reality check. We have eliminated the risky "Coating" track (Track B) and inserted a mandatory "Tribological & Mechanical Safety" gate before any dynamic testing. The focus shifts from just "stopping water" to "maintaining perfect contact physics."

## Phase 1: Material & Baseline Tribological Forensics
*   **Goal:** Establish the "Golden Standard" for electrical and mechanical performance of the stock MG1157 to ensure our modification matches or exceeds it.
*   **Actions:**
    *   **Porosity & Absorption Analysis:** Mercury intrusion porosimetry to map the moisture ingress paths.
    *   **Baseline Tribology:** Measure the stock MG1157's friction coefficient and contact voltage drop at operating temperature.
    *   **Mechanical Baseline:** Establish the flexural strength (breaking point) and hardness of the untreated brush.
*   **Lead:** R&D (Materials Science)

## Phase 2: Targeted Stabilization Development (Refined Tracks)
*   **Goal:** Develop modifications that block moisture but preserve conductivity and film formation.
*   **Actions:**
    *   **Track A (Impregnation):** Vacuum-pressure impregnation using conductive, low-friction hydrophobic resins. *Constraint:* Resin must not glaze the collector ring.
    *   **Track C (Thermal Conditioning):** Controlled annealing profiles to relax internal stresses. *Constraint:* Must not exceed binder carbonization thresholds (brittleness risk).
    *   **ELIMINATED:** Track B (Surface Sealing) - Rejected due to insulation risk.
*   **Lead:** R&D / Chemical Engineering

## Phase 3: The "Safety Gate" (Static Screening)
*   **Goal:** Pass/Fail screening before expensive dynamic testing.
*   **Actions:**
    *   **Electrical Conductivity Check:** Discard any prototype with >5% increase in bulk resistance vs. stock.
    *   **Mechanical Integrity Test:** 3-Point Bending Test to ensure modifications haven't made the brush brittle (maintaining ISO standards).
    *   **Static Swelling Test:** 24-hour humidity chamber exposure. Must show <0.05% expansion.
*   **Lead:** QA / Testing Lab

## Phase 4: Dynamic Validation (The "Rig Test")
*   **Goal:** Validate performance under real-world generator physics (RPM + Current + Humidity).
*   **Actions:**
    *   **Build/Commission Test Rig:** Setup a slip-ring test rig capable of 3600 RPM and 12 A/cm² current density.
    *   **The "Torture Cycle":** Run prototypes under load while cycling humidity between 20% and 95%.
    *   **Critical Metrics:**
        *   **Film Formation:** Visual and electrical inspection of the "Patina" (oxide film) on the ring.
        *   **Thermal Stability:** Monitor brush temperature (must not exceed stock by >10°C).
        *   **Wear Rate:** Projected brush life must meet industry standard (1 year+).
*   **Lead:** R&D / Engineering

## Phase 5: Intellectual Property & Market Launch
*   **Goal:** Productize the validated technology.
*   **Actions:**
    *   **Patent Filing:** Protect the specific impregnation formula or annealing curve.
    *   **Safety Datasheet:** Publish a "Safe Operation Area" (SOA) datasheet proving tribological stability.
    *   **Pilot Sales:** Select a "friendly" customer for the first field trial (beta site).
*   **Lead:** Product Management / Legal
