# Appendix 10B: The Chemical Track (Binder Protocol)
**Role:** Investigating the "Root Cause" of Hydrophilicity.

## 1. Variable A: Binder Candidates
*   **Baseline:** **Phenolic Resin** (Novolac). Known to be hydrophilic but easy to process.
*   **Challenger 1:** **Coal Tar Pitch**.
    *   *Why:* Historically proven hydrophobicity (aromatic rings).
    *   *Process:* Requires Hot Mixing (@ 150°C).
*   **Challenger 2:** **Furan Resin**.
    *   *Why:* High carbon yield structure, potentially lower porosity.
    *   *Process:* Acid catalyzed (Room Temp Mixing).

## 2. Standardization Protocol (Rheology)
To ensure valid comparison, we normalize mixing torque:
*   **Viscosity Target:** 1000 cPs ($\pm$ 200).
*   **Method:** Solvent dilution or temperature adjustment to ensure the "Green Body" starts on a level playing field.
