# Pipeline Version 1.0 (Revised Strategic Flow)

**Objective:** Rapid mitigation and permanent resolution of MG1157 Phase Brush swelling events to restore fleet availability and minimize revenue loss.

**Response to Critique:** This version shifts from a linear engineering study to a parallelized commercial-technical operation. It prioritizes "Containment" (stopping the bleeding) and "Vendor Leverage" (making Morgan Advanced Materials a partner/payer) over internal R&D spend.

## Phase 0: Immediate Containment & Operational Preservation (T=0 to T+2 Weeks)
*   **Goal:** Zero unplanned downtime while long-term fixes are investigated.
*   **Actions:**
    *   **Deploy Temporary SOP:** Implement "Accelerated Inspection & Swap" protocol. Reduce brush change intervals by 50% immediately to catch swelling before contact loss.
    *   **Environmental Triage:** adjust cooling gas humidity/temperature setpoints if correlation with swelling is suspected (based on historical logs).
    *   **Financial Baseline:** Calculate exact *Cost of Downtime (CoD)* vs. *Cost of Increased Maintenance* to set the budget ceiling for the permanent fix.
*   **Lead:** Operations / Maintenance

## Phase 1: Vendor Leverage & Technical Forensics (Parallel Track)
*   **Goal:** Determine if this is a manufacturing defect (Warranty Claim) or an Application Engineering failure (Design Revision).
*   **Actions:**
    *   **Morgan AM Engagement:** Initiate formal technical query with Morgan's Application Engineering team. Demand "Failure Analysis Report" for our specific batch.
    *   **Global Benchmarking:** Query industry user groups/competitors using MG1157. Is this systemic?
    *   **Forensic Sampling:** Send swollen vs. pristine samples to *independent* lab (verify against vendor specs). Measure swelling vs. standard holder tolerances.
*   **Lead:** Supply Chain (Commercial) / R&D (Technical)

## Phase 2: Strategic Gate & ROI Analysis (The "Kill Point")
*   **Goal:** Select the single most profitable path forward.
*   **Actions:**
    *   **Option A (Vendor Fix):** Morgan provides a "Grade B" brush or retrofit kit under warranty. (Cost: Low, Speed: Medium)
    *   **Option B (Design Mod):** We machine brush holders to increase tolerance. (Cost: High, Speed: Slow, Risk: High)
    *   **Option C (Competitor Switch):** Qualify a new vendor (e.g., Mersen, Schunk). (Cost: Medium, Speed: Slow)
    *   **Decision:** Compare ROI. If Morgan offers a fix, **STOP** internal R&D. If not, proceed to Phase 3.
*   **Lead:** Product Management / Investment Board

## Phase 3: Solution Development (If Vendor Fix Fails)
*   **Goal:** Engineer a verified retrofit.
*   **Actions:**
    *   **Design:** Develop specific modification (e.g., new brush grade, altered dimensions, improved cooling ducting).
    *   **Lab Validation (Rig Test):** *Crucial Change.* Do NOT test on live generators yet. Build/rent a brush-holder test rig to simulate thermal cycling and humidity.
*   **Lead:** R&D / Engineering

## Phase 4: Risk-Stratified Pilot (T+3 Months)
*   **Goal:** Live validation with minimal asset risk.
*   **Actions:**
    *   **Single Unit Pilot:** Install solution on *one* generator with high telemetry.
    *   **Daily Monitoring:** Real-time analysis of brush temperature and vibration.
    *   **Swelling Thresholds:** Weekly physical measurement. Success = <0.1mm expansion (or defined tolerance) over 500 operational hours.
*   **Lead:** Engineering / Operations

## Phase 5: Fleetwide Rollout & Commercial Closure
*   **Goal:** Standardize and recoup costs.
*   **Actions:**
    *   **Global SOP Update:** Revert inspection intervals to standard.
    *   **Stock Purge:** Quarantine/Return all defect-prone MG1157 batches.
    *   **Commercial Settlement:** Finalize warranty claims or price renegotiations with Morgan based on RCA findings.
*   **Lead:** Operations / Supply Chain
