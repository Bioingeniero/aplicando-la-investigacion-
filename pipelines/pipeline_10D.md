# Appendix 10D: The Finishing Track (Impregnation)
**Role:** The final barrier and safety net.

## 1. Variable D: Impregnation Strategy
*   **Baseline:** None (As-Sintered).
*   **Challenger 1:** **Hydrophobic Silane**.
    *   *Goal:* Chemical rejection of water at the pore surface.
*   **Challenger 2:** **PFPE Lubricating Oil**.
    *   *Goal:* **Dual Function.** Repels water AND provides lubrication (Safety Net against dry running).

## 2. VPI Protocol (Vacuum Pressure Impregnation)
*   **Vacuum:** < 5 mbar (30 mins) to evacuate air.
*   **Pressure:** +5 bar (60 mins) to force fluid deep into the matrix.
*   **Cure:** 150°C (for Silanes) vs. Ambient (for Oils).
