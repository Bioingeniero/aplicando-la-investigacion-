# Pipeline Version 3.0 (Campanil Corporate Integrated Strategy)

**Company:** Campanil Carbon Materials (Biobio Materials)
**Target:** MG1157 Phase Brush (Morgan Advanced Materials)
**Objective:** Develop a commercially viable, IP-protected solution to the "swelling via thermodynamic equilibrium" problem in wind generator brushes.

**Strategic Shift:** This pipeline balances high-tech innovation with corporate reality. Unlike previous iterations, it introduces an early **"Feasibility Filter"** to ensure technical solutions (like expensive additives or silver content changes) do not destroy profit margins before development begins.

## Phase 1: Diagnosis & Material Forensics (Department: R&D)
*   **Goal:** Pinpoint the exact physical mechanism of swelling in the MG1157.
*   **Specific Actions:**
    *   **Porosity Analysis (BET):** Measure the current pore structure and specific surface area to understand moisture retention capacity.
    *   **Binder Analysis:** Investigate the phenolic resins currently used to determine if they are the primary hydrophilic failure point.
    *   **Thermodynamic Baseline:** Establish the specific temperature/humidity point where "Joule Heating" + Environment triggers the swelling equilibrium.

## Phase 2: Strategic Feasibility Filter (Department: Product Mgmt / Finance)
*   **Goal:** Eliminate non-viable paths *before* wasting lab resources.
*   **Decision Matrix:**
    *   **Cost Analysis:** Silver (Ag) is expensive. If a solution requires *more* silver, it is rejected unless performance gains are massive. Solutions reducing Ag (to 30-40%) are preferred for margin, provided conductivity holds.
    *   **Manufacturability:** Can we produce it with current machinery? (e.g., is vacuum impregnation feasible in our current line?)
    *   **Outcome:** Select the top 3 methodologies for Phase 3.

## Phase 3: Solution Development Tracks (Department: R&D / Chemical Eng)
Based on `colegas.md` brainstorming, we execute three parallel tracks:

*   **Track A: Chemical Modification (Hydrophobic Additives)**
    *   *Concept:* Introduce agents to repel moisture without insulating the brush.
    *   *Candidates:* Trimetoxysilane (Surface treatment), PDMS (Polydimethylsiloxane), or Micro-particle PTFE (Teflon).
    *   *Risk:* Must monitor electrical conductivity closely.

*   **Track B: Structural/Alloy Modification**
    *   *Concept:* Alter the base matrix to reduce the coefficient of thermal expansion.
    *   *Action:* Test prototypes with reduced Metal/Silver content (down to 30-40%) or substitute with Bronzes (Cu-Sn) or Cu-Ni alloys to change rigidity and thermal response.

*   **Track C: Process Engineering (Pre-conditioning)**
    *   *Concept:* "Cheat" the equilibrium.
    *   *Action:* Develop a pre-installation protocol where brushes are expanded to their "swollen" state *before* precision machining/sizing, ensuring stable dimensions during operation.

## Phase 4: Prototyping & Validation (Department: Operations / QA)
*   **Goal:** Prove it works in the real world.
*   **Actions:**
    *   **Small Scale Execution:** Manufacturing of 10-20 units per Track.
    *   **Environmental Chamber Testing:** 95% Humidity + Thermal cycling.
    *   **Critical Metrics:**
        *   Dimensional Stability (Expansion < Tolerance).
        *   Friction Coefficient (Must remain low for lubrication).
        *   Conductivity (Must meet 18 A/cm² rating).

## Phase 5: Industrial Scaling & Protection (Department: Manufacturing / Legal)
*   **Goal:** Turn the prototype into a product.
*   **Actions:**
    *   **IP Protection:** Legal department to file patents on the specific additive mix or pre-conditioning process (Track A or C).
    *   **Supply Chain:** Procurement to source bulk Silanes or alternative Alloys identified in Phase 3.
    *   **Housing Redesign (Optional):** If material changes aren't enough, Engineering to propose "Design with Tolerance" changes to the brush holder/springs to mechanically accommodate expansion.
