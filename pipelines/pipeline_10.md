# Pipeline Version 10.0: The "Morgan Integrated Strategy"
**Status:** **Presentation Ready (.pptx Structure)**
**Context:** Merges Morgan's Industrial Capability with the Team's Data-Driven Methodology.

## Slide 1: Executive Summary
*   **Objective:** Eliminate "Internal Swelling" in MG1157 Generator Brushes.
*   **Approach:** A Process-Driven R&D Pipeline optimizing 4 Key Levers.
*   **Methodology:** 4-Phase Design of Experiments (DOE) underpinned by Python/Jupyter analytics.
*   **Outcome:** A validated manufacturing recipe that ensures mechanical stability without compromising tribological safety.

## Slide 2: The Core Problem (Root Cause)
*   **Diagnosis:** Swelling is a **Thermodynamic Equilibrium** failure.
*   **Mechanism:** The current Binder/Porosity network absorbs humidity, leading to dimensional expansion ($Z_{\perp}$) and mechanical lock-up.
*   **Solution Strategy:** "Don't fix the symptom, close the pores."

## Slide 3: The 4 Process Levers (Input Variables)
*   **Lever 1 (Chemistry):** **Binder Type** (Phenolic vs. Pitch vs. Furan). *[See Appx 10B]*
*   **Lever 2 (Mechanical):** **Pressing Pressure** (150-350 MPa). *[See Appx 10C]*
*   **Lever 3 (Thermal):** **Carbonization Temp** (800-1100°C). *[See Appx 10C]*
*   **Lever 4 (Finishing):** **Impregnation** (Silane vs. PFPE Oil). *[See Appx 10D]*

## Slide 4: The Data Engine (Jupyter Integration)
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  **Screening:** ANOVA Analysis to find the "Big Hitters" (Sensitivity).
    2.  **Optimization:** Factorial Design to map the "Sweet Spot".
    3.  **Decision:** Pareto Charts to justify the ROI of process changes.
*   *[See Appx 10A for Data Strategy]*

## Slide 5: Validation Gates & Safety
*   **Gate 1 (Swelling):** Accelerated Autoclave Test ($<0.1\%$ expansion).
*   **Gate 2 (Safety):** Tribological Safe Zone ($\mu < 0.25$).
    *   *Critical Note:* We prioritize "Safe Operation" over "Zero Swelling." A dry brush destroys the generator; a swelling brush stops it. We aim for the balance.
*   *[See Appx 10E for Protocols]*

## Slide 6: Expected Deliverables
*   **3D Surface Plots:** Visualizing the Manufacturing Window (Pressure vs. Temp vs. Swelling).
*   **The "Golden Recipe":** The final setpoints for the Production Line.
