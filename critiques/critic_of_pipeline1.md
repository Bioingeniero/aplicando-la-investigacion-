# CEO Directive: Strategic Realignment of Pipeline V1.0

**To:** Head of Pipeline Design / Product Management
**From:** CEO
**Date:** 2026-01-21
**Subject:** REJECTION of Pipeline V1.0 - Pivot to Marketable Innovation

## Strategic Misalignment
I have reviewed Pipeline V1.0. **It is rejected.**

You are thinking like a facility manager, not a market leader. This pipeline is entirely defensive—it focuses on "stopping the bleeding" and "holding the vendor accountable." That is small thinking.

**Our goal is not just to fix our generators. Our goal is to own the solution.**

If the MG1157 swells for us, it swells for everyone. I don't want to beg Morgan Advanced Materials for a warranty credit. I want to develop a superior, swelling-resistant material modification (or a completely new composite) that **we can patent and sell** to every other operator facing this issue.

## Specific Directives

### 1. Kill "Containment" (Phase 0)
*   **Directive:** Stop wasting resources on "SOP updates" and "inspection intervals." That is operational noise. If a brush fails, replace it.
*   **Reason:** We are not here to band-aid a bad product. We are here to invent a good one. Divert those man-hours to R&D.

### 2. Abandon "Vendor Leverage" (Phase 1)
*   **Directive:** Do not ask Morgan for a fix. Do not wait for their permission.
*   **Reason:** If they had a better brush, they would be selling it. Relying on them puts our destiny in their hands. We will treat the MG1157 as a raw material base, not a finished solution.

### 3. The New Objective: Material Upgrade
*   **Directive:** The core of this pipeline must be **Material Science**.
*   **Goal:** We need a proprietary treatment (impregnation, coating, or thermal processing) that stabilizes the MG1157 matrix against humidity and temperature.

### 4. Commercialization Focus
*   **Directive:** Every test must lead to a datasheet, not just an internal report.
*   **Goal:** The output of this pipeline is a product: **"The [Company Name] Stabilized Phase Brush."**

## Required Actions for Pipeline V2.0
Rewrite the pipeline immediately. It should look like a **Product Development Lifecycle**, not a Maintenance Repair schedule.

1.  **Phase 1:** Material Characterization (Why does it swell? Chemistry/Physics).
2.  **Phase 2:** Prototyping Upgrades (Impregnation X, Heat Treat Y, Coating Z).
3.  **Phase 3:** Comparative Testing (Our Modified Brush vs. Stock MG1157).
4.  **Phase 4:** Patent & Go-to-Market Strategy.

We are not fixing a bug. We are building a new revenue stream. Get to work.
