# Executive Review: Critique of Pipeline V0

**To:** Project Management Team
**From:** Strategic Investment Board & Technical Oversight
**Date:** 2026-01-21
**Subject:** CRITICAL REVIEW of Proposed Pipeline V0 for MG1157 Brush Failure

## General Assessment
While Pipeline V0 outlines a logical engineering flow, **it lacks the aggressive commercial focus required by the company.** It reads too much like a standard troubleshooting manual and not enough like a strategic initiative to protect revenue and assets.

As investors, we are not interested in "researching" a problem for the sake of knowledge. We are interested in **restoring operational capability at the lowest cost and risk.**

## Strategic Gaps & Major Concerns

### 1. The "Buy vs. Build" Fallacy (Vendor Leverage)
*   **Critique:** The pipeline assumes *we* must immediately shoulder the burden of R&D (Phase 2 & 3).
*   **Missing Step:** We are using a specific product (Morgan MG1157). Why is the first step not **engaging the vendor**?
*   **Requirement:** Phase 1/2 must include a "Vendor Accountability & Support" stream. Are other clients facing this? Does Morgan have a retrofit? We should not spend capital solving a manufacturing defect if the warranty or supplier engineering support covers it.

### 2. Missing "Containment" Strategy
*   **Critique:** The pipeline moves from "Problem Definition" to "Root Cause" to "Solution." This is too slow.
*   **Missing Step:** What do we do *today* to keep the generators running?
*   **Requirement:** We need an **Immediate Mitigation / Containment Phase**. (e.g., increased inspection frequency, temporary cooling adjustments, swapping brushes more frequently) to stop the bleeding while the long-term fix is studied.

### 3. Financial Impact & ROI Definition
*   **Critique:** Phase 1 mentions "quantifying the extent," but this is vague.
*   **Requirement:** We need defined **Financial KPIs**.
    *   What is the Cost of Downtime per hour?
    *   What is the Cost of Replacement parts vs. the Cost of the R&D project?
    *   The "Solution Strategy" (Phase 3) must be ranked by **ROI**, not just technical feasibility.

### 4. Risk Profile in Validation
*   **Critique:** Phase 4 suggests "Pilot Test on a non-critical generator."
*   **Concern:** Do we *have* non-critical generators sitting idle? Unlikely.
*   **Requirement:** We need a risk-stratified testing approach. Can we test in a rig first? "Non-critical" implies we have spare capacity, which may not be true.

## Specific Questions for the Team

1.  **Morgan Advanced Materials Relationship:** Have we contacted their technical applications engineering team? If not, why is this not Step 1?
2.  **Swelling Thresholds:** What is the precise dimension change that causes loss of contact? Do we have this data, or are we guessing?
3.  **Timeline:** This pipeline looks like it could take 6 months. We need a solution path that delivers a containment fix in 2 weeks and a permanent fix in 3 months.
4.  **Go/No-Go Gates:** Where are the kill points? If the RCA shows the brushes are chemically incompatible with our specific cooling gas, we shouldn't continue "testing." We should switch products immediately.

## Action Items
Redraft the pipeline to Version 1.0 incorporating:
1.  **Vendor Management** track.
2.  **Immediate Containment** phase.
3.  **Financial Gateways** (Cost of Inaction vs. Cost of Solution).
